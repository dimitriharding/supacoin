### How was Supabase used

---

Supabase was used to store the NFT assets (storage) and metadata (database)

### Idea behind project

---

Web3 technology is going mainstream but I believe it is still not as accessible as most would want it to be.
It involves real money, and the Ethereum network gas fees are very high.

I wanted to see what it would take to create a production-ready NFT project from generating my own art,
storing my own assets, deploying on the Polygon network (lower gas fees),
and creating dApp that curious individual can use to mint one of the free Supabase inspired NFTs.

I will be submitting this project isn test mode, but that's only because I am not able to deploy my smart contract to Production in time before the hackathon ends.
Once I get to transfer MATIC to my wallet, I will be able to deploy this NFT project that anyone can use.

It's still works on the testnet, so anyone can play around with it using fake MATIC
