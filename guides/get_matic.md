Real MATIC:

- Use an exchange like [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) or [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) to
  buy MATIC and send it to your address
- Use service like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) to convert your ETH into MATIC and then deposit it your [Polygon Wallet]('https://wallet.polygon.technology/wallet')

* The first option is the cheapest way. Will be adding more info here when I deploy to PROD and buy MATIC
